    <p>5G is the fifth generation of mobile network technology, promising faster speeds, ultra-low latency, and the
      ability to connect a vast number of devices. It will unlock new potential for industries, from healthcare to
      transportation. In this article, we’ll explore how 5G will change the way we live, work, and connect.</p>

    <h2>What is 5G?</h2>
    <p>5G is more than just faster mobile internet. It’s a game-changer for everything from communication to
      technological innovations. With speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G, 5G will enable innovations that weren’t
      previously possible.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of 5G</h2>
    <ul class="features">
      <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> 5G promises download speeds of up to 10 Gbps.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> Real-time communication will become seamless with virtually no delay.</li>
      <li><strong>Massive Device Connectivity:</strong> 5G will support billions of devices simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Network Slicing:</strong> Operators can create virtual networks tailored to specific needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Concerns</h2>
    <p>As exciting as 5G is, its rollout is not without challenges. Issues like the high cost of infrastructure,
      security concerns, and the need for more research on health effects still need to be addressed.</p>
