    <p>Web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with new frameworks, tools, and trends shaping the way
      developers build websites and applications. In this article, we’ll dive into some of the most exciting
      developments in the world of web development in 2025.</p>

    <h2>1. The Rise of Serverless Architectures</h2>
    <p>Serverless computing is becoming a cornerstone of modern web development. It allows developers to focus on
      writing code without worrying about server management. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and
      Azure Functions have made it easier than ever to deploy scalable applications.</p>

    <h2>2. JAMstack Revolution</h2>
    <p>JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) is changing the way websites are built. By decoupling the frontend from the
      backend, JAMstack improves performance, scalability, and security. Frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby are leading
      the charge in this space.</p>

    <h2>3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h2>
    <p>PWAs are bridging the gap between websites and mobile apps. They offer offline functionality, push notifications,
      and an app-like user experience—all while being accessible through a web browser. PWAs are becoming a must-have
      for businesses aiming to improve user engagement.</p>

    <h2>4. Accessibility and Inclusivity</h2>
    <p>As the internet becomes a fundamental part of daily life, ensuring that websites are accessible to everyone is
      critical. Developers are prioritizing accessibility through semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and testing tools like
      Lighthouse.</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Driven Web Development</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is streamlining the web development process. From AI-powered design tools like Figma and
      Adobe XD to code generation tools, developers are leveraging AI to boost efficiency and creativity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The web development landscape in 2025 is more exciting than ever, with technologies and trends that empower
      developers to build faster, more efficient, and user-friendly web applications. Staying ahead of these trends will
      be essential for anyone in the field.</p>
